# Dictated-translator
This may probably help you with libraries that work with speech to text, translate text to many languages and text to speech. All this for free, without log in to any service, This is a simple but functional project.

I had some troubles with the google_trans library, those were usually issues with the library by itself, i solve it installing googletrans 3.1.0a0 and it works properly with the project, I would recommend you to install that specific version before run the project.
You should not have problems with the rest of the project.

If you change the languages translation, you may have some issues with the text-to-speech, because I created to be run from English to Spanish.
Also you can check the documentation of each library if you wanna make some changes, you only have to change some data in the already written code and it will tell you what part of the project is not working, just in case.

To save time the libraries you must install are:

googletrans (3.1.0a0)
Speech_Recognition
pyttsx3
pyaudio
